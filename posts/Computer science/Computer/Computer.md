The CPU consists of two main components: the Control Unit (CU) and the Arithmetic-Logic Unit (ALU). The CU coordinates between CPU components for the smooth execution of instructions (or programs) in the CPU. The ALU performs the arithmetic and logical operations required while executing programs in the CPU.

The CPU takes input from the input devices, takes instructions from the main memory or RAM, executes the instructions, and outputs the results through the output devices.

Hardware refers to all the physical components in the computer, such as the CPU, hard disk, RAM, SMPS, and buses while [Software](./Softwares.md)
is a sequence of logical instructions written by a programmer to instruct the computer on performing a particular task.
