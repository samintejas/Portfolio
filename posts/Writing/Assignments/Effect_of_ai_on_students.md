# Effect of AI-Enabled Services like ChatGPT on students

AI-enabled services like Google's gemeni and OpenAI's ChatGPT are revolutionary technologies
that can shape the humanities future.With a simple prompts the AI can give answers to varous kinds of 
question by understanding it, generate images and videos and much more.Students use these tools to learn,
solve problems and explore new topics.However there are some negative impacts on students 
that cannot be neglected.

Primarly, easy access to AI-generated solutions may weaken students' learning ablility. There's growing concern is that, students might blindly copy AI-provided answers, completing assignments without genuinely engaging with the material. This practice could violate education's fundamental purpose of development of independent thinking and deep understanding.Additionaly, The impact of AI on academic integrity is a concern in educational institutions. AI's capabilities pose risks to online examination integrity, particularly in tertiary education. While advanced systems to tackle this are being deployed, Susnjak (2022) argues these may not provide foolproof solutions to this complex issue.

As AI continues to evolve, educational institutions must adapt their policies and practices. The goal should be to absorb AI's benefits while mitigating its potential negative impacts on learning and academic standards.Mollick and Mollick (2022) note that AI enables more creative teaching approaches, potentially enhancing the educational experience when used thoughtfully. Acheiving this balance requires ongoing research and open dialogue among educators, students, and policymakers to shape an educational environment that leverages AI's potential while safeguarding core learning values.
