> - [Knott, Deborah. Writing an Annotated Bibliography. Writing Advice. The Writing Centre. New College University of Toronto.](https://advice.writing.utoronto.ca/types-of-writing/annotated-bibliography/)


### Brainstorming

one of the first step in academic writing , it is

- generating and exploring ideas
- deciding what to do
- organizing ideas

How -

- listing
  - define topic
  - list out general ideas on the topic and categorize them
  - reject the irrelevant ideas ie. check whats on scope
  - arrange ideas based on importance
  - write sentence on each idea
- idea mapping
  - topic in a circle at the center
  - relate main ideas above arrows surrounding circle
  - further idea by adding more details
  - verify and select/reject
  - create connections
  - write sentence
- annotated biblography
  - create list of published research articles related to the topic
  - note down relevent points from each one
  - create categorize and organize the points
  - write and make the connections

### searching information in the internet

good databases : google scholar , JSTOR , Researchgate, SCOPUS and web of science
publishers : cambridge univercity press, oxford univercity press, sage , roulesge, elseiver , blackwell , IEEE and other univercity presses
other : journals listed in SCOPUS  or web of science

there will be paid and free information , permission from authors are required

wikipedia is not a reliable source of information

- search for the right keywords
- use multiple resources and cross-check
- keep track , bookmark the sites for future reference
- know good sources in your field
- think about copyright laws , plagerism etc
- go through the references in the reference articles
- provide correct urls in the writing

### Creating idea maps

idea maps can be used to visualize the ideas , stay focused and draw strong conclutions

1. identify keywords and important points
2. start making connections , hierarchy and links (fonts , symbols , colors etc can be used)
3. once 1 and 2 are done , there will be a central theme
4. review and refine

### How to build connections

- list out the points/keyowrds/ideas
- categorize it , categorize normally or can be catogorize under questions like what is it ?  , how it works ? applications ? etc

for connections we can :
- we can connect familar and unfamilar ideas
- we can put together claim
- evidence and explanation that are written in order
- cause and effect relationship
- comparison between/among ideas
- facts and details
- critical and general ideas

### Delimiting ideas

what is it ?
- it is narrowing down of scope of the paragraph
->
- including content that is adequate
- deciding the depth of the presentation
- setting boundaries (dont exceed scope)
- avoid unwanted elaboration

Why delimit ?
- more reader engagement
- staying focused
- achieving writing objectives
- making content more accessible

How
- identofy main idea
- list the supporting detail
- write the paragraph
- check the detail in order of importance
- keep important ones
- remove the unwanted ones

### Signposting

- it reffers to words and phrases that guide the reader when they read your content.
- two types
  - major signpost
    - intro
    - conclution
    - main argument
    - direction of argument
    - opening phrases
    - closing phrases
  - linking
    - words connecting ideas/sentences
    - it emphasize the arguments and transitions in the text
    - establish relationships between sentences in a piece of text
    - help us maintain coherence (flow) in the paragraph
    - articulate the structure of the writing
    - organizes the text

- conjunctions - can be used to follow the text further
- verbs - can be used to define ,assert , claim , state , prove etc
- singpost in the topic sentence can be used in the concluding sentence in their past tense

### Signposting of order

lets say we are defining procedure where the procedure steps ar orders or lets say that some thing have 3 reasons , the signpost like step1 step2 .. or reason like first reason , second reson .. are singposts of order

- listing (firstly , secondly , to begin with , following this , afterward , then , next , lastly , then , finally , to conclude etc)
- referrign backwards (initially , as we have seen , as previously discussed , prior to this etc)
- transitioning between points (next , it is now necessary , turning now to, this section defines, moving on to , having considered)
- referring forward (as will be explained later , in the following section , as we shall see ...)

### signposting of relations

they tell us the relation between two ideas

- additions - shows connections to the previous point (in addition , additionaly , also , further)
- illustration - shows examples (in particular , for example , to illustrate , for instance , such as , namely , notably, by , one such , as demonstrated)
- similarity (currespondingly , similarly , just as , so too , likewise , in the same way)
- emphasis (mainly , in fact , importantly , in particular, indeed)
- contrast (conversly , rather , whereas , even so , despite thos , however)
- reformulation - say it in other words (rather , put simply ..)
- cause and effect (as a result , this causes , hence , for this reason , therefore)
- summary (overall , in summary , to sum up)

### choosing and using appropriate signposts

choosing correct words can strengthen the writing , for example in contrast , consequently and however have different meaning we should use each in correct context
"coding has simplified qualitative research. it has enhanced the quality of interpretations. **Moreover** , it has brought challenges to the researchers"
in the above paragraph , the use of moreover is wrong , our sentence starts with a positive take but moreover is emphasing a negative take, this might confuce the reader.

- unnecessary singposting can might appear like an activity to increase the number of words
- the focus should be on conveying the idea in an efficient manner
- academic writing dont have to be wordy/poetic
- using unnecessary singposting can tire the reader as the reader keep on have to refer the connections , relations etc
- can hurt precision in writing if not used correctly , example - "the idea is not only outdated and old fashioned but also in many ways ineffective and unattractive" , here "not only .. but also" is not necessary
