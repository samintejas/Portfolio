    "longBio": "I'm a passionate Backend Developer with more that 3 years of experience at 6D Technologies in Bangalore, where I've been working on high-performance systems for Telecom BSS stacks. My days are filled with Java-based billing and payment systems, and I absolutely love diving into problem solving and tackling complex debugging challenges. When I'm not accelerating billing systems or mentoring junior devs, you'll find me creating usefull systems with modern technologies like go. I'm also an open-source enthusiast, contributing via Spaciery, in my free time. Whether it's collaborating on telecom solutions or sharing knowledge through code, I'm all about creating reliable, scalable tech that makes a difference.",
